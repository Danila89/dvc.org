# Data Versioning

DVC enables [version control] for data science. But DVC does not actually
implement versioning directly! Instead, DVC focuses on [codifying your data]:
generating small [metafiles] that you can handle with standard [Git workflows]
(commits, branching, pull requests, etc.).

The resulting projects are neatly organized in the "space dimension", having
only the files and directories needed at the time and without complicated, ad
hoc file names like `2022-10-20_linear-model_v2-Carl`. Project versions live in
the "time dimension" ([Git history]).

## Cloud versioning

_New in DVC 2.30.0 (see `dvc version`)_

To simplify remote data operations, DVC now supports native versioning of files
and directories on several cloud providers. This means that you can browse your
files normally as you would see them in your local workspace.

**Data version control** is the unifying trait across DVC features. The next
page will explore [basic data management operations] with versioned data.
